    <h2><em>MOTW:</em> I had a gopher blog for a while so I'm pretty sure I know what I'm doing. What's frontend though?</h2>
<p>If somebody tells you <em>retrocomputing is just a stage</em>, don't listen to them and go grab a <a href="http://sdf.org">unix shell</a> to have some good old fun.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>This blog is a collection of personal notes on various programming and tech related topics. It's mostly for my own benefit but if you find something interesting among the ramblings I'm glad to have shared.</p>
<p>I worked in system programming, graphics, and computational graph theory. My main language was C. Nowadays I like experimenting in various other fields and code in Python.</p>
<p>I find it useful to keep up a .plan like some other more capable minds used to do. It helps me to structure my goals and reflect on what I’m currently working on. So if you're interested in what I'm up to, you are welcome to <a href="/dotplan-23-08-2022/">read it</a>. I also like to produce more thoughtful pieces on various topics which you may find under the general category of musings.</p>
