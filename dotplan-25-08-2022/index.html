    <h3>Bots Away!</h3>
<p>Another big chunk of the current project is complete with another Telegram bot up and running. I ran it in production environment by <em>ssh</em>’ing to our vps and then doing <code>nohup python bot.py</code> before logging off for the day. I’m not completely mad — I have alerts in place. But if that gives you the shivers, it’s rightfully so. My only excuse is that’s a tool bot for internal use, and I will setup proper environment later.</p>
<p>Seeing how I have quite a few bots in the project now, it got me thinking about managing and monitoring bots in general. The methods I’m somewhat familiar with: 1) wrap ’em in containers, deploy on different VPSs and take advantage of the usual toolset (OS provided + smart logging in bots + etc.); 2) deploying as cloud functions (platform monitor tools + separate logging service for bots).</p>
<p>#1 feels almost anti-ecological. Considering that some bots do fine living under one server (in terms of resources and latency). #2 is okay but I’d love to have either a bot-specific cloud platform and/or specific metrics tooling. Perhaps as a library providing unified interface for reporting which should be included in the bot project.</p>
<h3>Unannotated 3rd-party Code (even worse when it's yours)</h3>
<p>For <code>x: SomeCollection, tuple( s ) == (s[0], s[1], .., s[n])</code> or <code>(s,)</code>? Better figure it out before embarking on few hours of hunting a particularly illusive bug in your hash calculations.</p>
